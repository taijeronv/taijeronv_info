  ## Why you should hire me
Professional, competent, and reliable.

Have you ever been in an organization where there was this one guy that always
got things done? You know what I'm talking about, he doesn't need supervision,
always accomplishes his tasks, and does it to a high standard.

**I'm that guy.**

My current boss describes me as his safety net. He knows that I can run the team
in his absence, manage all the personalities in the office, and get
things done. Professional, competent, and reliable.
