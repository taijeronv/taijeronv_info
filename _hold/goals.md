I have a number of personal and professional goals that I would like to
accomplish in the next five years.

### Personal Goals
- In one year I'd like take my Russian to a B2 level.
- In three months I would like to complete the software requirements and rules
  for my passion project NextGen Wargame (NGW).
- In one year, I would like to have a playable demo.
- In 18 months, I would like to have a minimum viable product (MVP).

What I'd really like is for a company to take an interest in my project and hire
me to get it off the ground.
