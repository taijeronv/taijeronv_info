**Job Goals**
- Although my skillset is strongest in the military domain (education, training,
  or operating), I am open to working in another job sector.
- I am currently expanding my skill set to include programming
  (Javascript/Python) although it would take me more time to become productive
  as a coder.

**Full or Part Time**
- Full time employment.
- I would consider part time if I could continue to live in Ukraine, but
  deploy to wherever I was needed. For example, if I were in a training job, I
  could live in Ukraine then deploy to the training site when required. The
  reason is the cost of living. I cannot live in the US or other parts
  of Europe if I'm only working part-time it would cost too much.
- Working remotely from home is certainly an option (obviously, this would
  allow me to continue to live in Ukraine).

**Location**
- If the job is fulltime I would happily relocate.
- If the job were part-time the only way to make that work is to continue to
  live in Ukraine for the reasons I stated above.
- The bottom line is I will go wherever I am needed.


### What am I working on?
The NextGen Wargame is a project that I started on my own initiative because I love
wargames and designing one was a natural "next step" for me.  

I believe we can improve the quality of military education by using computer
wargames as a tool to add a dynamic operational environment for the student to
practice in. The NextGen Wargame is designed to be that tool.

## If you're interested in developing a useful game for the PME market please contact me.

I've always been interested in programming, creating software, and web
development.

This is what I used to create this site:
- I created the site using a static site generator called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
- All the content is written using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/). 
- For version control, I use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (command line), and I
  use [Github](https://github.com/) to store my repository.
- I host the site on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for free. 
- I registered my own domain name at [iwanmyname](https://iwantmyname.com/) (I
  have two other domains registered with them.).
