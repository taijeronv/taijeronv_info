In many military education institutions, the most popular tool for teaching tactics is the Tactical Decision Game (TDG), sometimes called Tactical Decision Exercise (TDE).  

Places like West Point or ROTC use the TDG as a planning exercise, with little or no execution.

**How it works**  
1. The instructor gives the student a situation and mission. 
2. The student writes an OPORD and a course of action and creates an overlay with the appropriate ops graphics on a map.
3. The instructor grades each of the products and gives the student some feedback. In some cases, the instructor may lead a group discussion using one of the student's solutions.

Without the ability to execute their plan in an operational environment means the student isn't getting the full benefit of the instruction.  For example in a paper-based TDG at what point does the student experience the unexpected? The enemy has a say as well but how is that conveyed in a paper TDG? Typically the instructor provides a thinking enemy but how can they do that for a class of 18 students?

So, when does the student get the opportunity to "think" their way out of a problem?

They don't.

## The NextGen Wargame
The NextGen Wargame is NOT meant to replace paper-based TDGs. It is intended to give the student a "complete" learning experience by adding an execution component.

- It enables the student to practice in a dynamic operational environment where the enemy, terrain, and weather have an effect.
- The ability to practice risk making decisions appropriate to their command level.
- Experimentation. Imagine the learning that takes place when a student can compare and contrast different courses of action or tactics.
- Critical Analysis (AAR). Ability to watch a "replay" of the operation then analyze it step-by-step. What went wrong or right, and why? 
What could be done better, and why? 
You get the picture. The "WHY" is arguably the most essential part of learning to think.  

### Tell me about the NextGen Wargame
The NextGen Wargame is a computer wargame that can be played in a web browser and is delivered over the internet or local area network. I chose the computer "format" because it's easier and faster to play than a manual game.  I think "analog" games are great but only under the right conditions.

If you have 45 minutes for a class of 18 students, then a manual wargame may not be useful.  Add to that the expertise needed to keep an analog game moving, and it all of a sudden become impractical.

For more information take a look at the design document which is under constant revision.

**The NextGen Wargame**
- The right level of detail, easy to play and understand.
- Playable in a web browser, the operating system does not matter.
- Specifically designed as an education tool, NOT an exercise driver.
- Designed by someone who plays games, has over 20 years of military experience, AND who actually used games in a classroom setting (that's me).

I should say something about that last point. Just because you're a gamer or have military experience doesn't mean you're an expert at knowing what's required to make a useful teaching tool.

However, in my case, I've done just about everything you can imagine when it comes to teaching with games.  

I've observed and taught thousands of cadets using games like 
"Follow Me" and "Virtual Battlespace." I've written requirements, performed validation, and developed content.  

## The way ahead  
I'm currently working on the rules and requirements.  Maybe I'm a glutton for punishment, but I really like writing requirements.

I'm trying to find some local talent to start work on a proof of principle.

I think it's feasible to have an MVP in less than a year, given the light modeling requirements.  If I had a team of coders and a web developer we could complete the project in less than a year.
