					<h2>International Monitoring Officer</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">PAE, September 2014 - Present</p>
					<p>I plan all major team level operations. My military experience is invaluable in this process and ensures the mission is conducted safely and efficiently. I also write reports regarding the demobilization of the military which contributes to creating situational awareness..</p>

					<h2>Senior Curriculum Developer</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">Odesa Land Forces Academy, Odesa Ukraine August 2013 - September 2014</p>
					<p>I developed a curriculum for 3rd-year cadets that significantly improved their knowledge of how small units in NATO operate. The focus of the instruction was on infantry platoon offensive and defensive operations. I also implemented the Follow Me program, which provided the cadets an opportunity to execute their plans in a dynamic operational environment giving them an opportunity to practice making tactical decisions and solving problems.</p>

					<h2>Police Mentor Afghan Uniformed Police</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">DynCorp International, Khowst Province, Afghanistan June 2011 - August 2013</p>
					<p>I created a two-week induction course focused on giving my ten-man police unit an understanding of how US Army units operate while on patrol. My instruction gave them the skills and understanding they needed to be more effective while on patrol with their US counterparts. My course focused on first-aid, patrolling, battle drills, terminology, planning, and leadership.</p>

					<h2>USMA Deputy Head of The Simulation Center</h2>
					<p class="subDetails">United States Military Academy, West Point, NY Aug 2004-Jun 2011</p>
					<p>I co-developed the “Follow Me” program, which was designed as a tool to teach infantry platoon operations. I integrated it into the 3rd and 4th-year military education curriculum, which allowed the cadets to execute platoon missions in a dynamic operational environment giving them a more in-depth experiential learning experience. I also introduced the academy to Virtual Battlespace 2, which is a virtual first-person-shooter with a high degree of detail. VBS2 was used during cadet basic training to familiarize the cadets with squad fire and movement techniques before they went to the field.</p>
