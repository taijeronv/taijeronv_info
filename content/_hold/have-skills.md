**Job Goals**
- Although my skillset is strongest in the military domain (education, training,
  or operating), I am open to working in another job sector.
- I am currently expanding my skill set to include programming
  (Javascript/Python) although it would take me more time to become productive
  as a coder.

**Full or Part Time**
- Full time employment.
- I would consider part time if I could continue to live in Ukraine, but
  deploy to wherever I was needed. For example, if I were in a training job, I
  could live in Ukraine then deploy to the training site when required. The
  reason is the cost of living. I cannot live in the US or other parts
  of Europe if I'm only working part-time it would cost too much.
- Working remotely from home is certainly an option (obviously, this would
  allow me to continue to live in Ukraine).

**Location**
- If the job is fulltime I would happily relocate.
- If the job were part-time the only way to make that work is to continue to
  live in Ukraine for the reasons I stated above.
- The bottom line is I will go wherever I am needed.
