description = """If you're interested in improving the quality of your PME program, I can help you develop exciting and useful content.  Drawing pretty graphics on a map or reading ["On War"](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2017/11/12/the-trinity-and-the-law-of-war) by Clausewitz does not make you a master strategist or tactician.  Quality practice plus expert instruction is how we raise competent tactical thinkers.  """

description = """I can guide any organization in implementing and integrating games into their program of instruction.

description = """ I love using [mind maps](https://www.lifehack.org/articles/work/how-to-mind-map-in-three-small-steps.html) to organize my thoughts and ideas.  My favorite program is [Freemind](http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) which is available for free.  If you've never tried mind mapping you should, especially if you write.  It's also one of the best ways to brainstorm."""

In my spare time I enjoy playing [Eve Online](https://www.eveonline.com/) which is a space themed Massive Multiplayer Online game. Eve is complicated with a really steep learning curve.

At the moment, my focus is on developing the [NextGen Wargame](https://www.nextgenwargame.com/), and for that, I want to use the [Phaser framework](https://phaser.io/) which means Javascript.  I'm also interested in learning the [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) to improve my web development skills."""
