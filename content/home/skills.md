description = """Drawing pretty graphics on a map or reading ["On War"](https://thestrategybridge.org/the-bridge/2017/11/12/the-trinity-and-the-law-of-war) by Clausewitz does not make you a master strategist or tactician.  Quality practice plus expert instruction is how we raise competent tactical thinkers.  If you're interested in improving the quality of your PME program, I can help you develop exciting and useful content."""

name = "Simulations and Gaming"
description = """Most organizations understand the benefits of using games but struggle to define their requirements.  I was fortunate to gain insights into the use of games from observing thousands of cadets playing "Follow Me" and "Virtual Battlespace."  With my experience, I can guide any organization in implementing and integrating games into their program of instruction."""

description = """ Whether it's training the Afghan Police, patrolling in Khowst province, or serving on a Brigade Staff, I can operate under pressure under stressful conditions.  If you are looking for a rock-solid performer who is competent and reliable, then look no further."""

name = "Mind maps"
description = """ I love using [mind maps](https://www.lifehack.org/articles/work/how-to-mind-map-in-three-small-steps.html) to organize my thoughts and ideas.  My favorite program is [Freemind](http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) which is available for free.  If you've never tried mind mapping you should, especially if you write.  It's also one of the best ways to brainstorm."""

name = "Eve online"
description = """  
In my spare time I enjoy playing [Eve Online](https://www.eveonline.com/) which is a space themed Massive Multiplayer Online game. Eve is complicated with a really steep learning curve. Think of it as "[Ender's Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game)" for [fleet commanders in space](https://www.denofgeek.com/us/games/eve-online/280213/eve-online-best-battles)."""

name = "Javascript Programming"
description = """I love Python and Javascript and want to learn both.  At the moment, my focus is on developing the [NextGen Wargame](https://www.nextgenwargame.com/), and for that, I want to use the [Phaser framework](https://phaser.io/) which means Javascript.  I'm also interested in learning the [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/) to improve my web development skills."""
