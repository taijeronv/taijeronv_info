  description = """Drawing pretty graphics on a map or reading "On War" does not make you a tactician or strategist.  The most important aspect to learning tactics is understanding the decisions you make and why you made them.  I do not teach my students what to think I teach them how to think.  Quality practice plus expert instruction is how we begin to raise competent tactical decision-makers.  I can help you develop a program with interesting and useful content."""

I was fortunate to gain insights in the use of games from observing thousands of cadets playing Follow Me and Virtual Battlespace.  With my experience I can guide any organization in implementing and integrating games into their program of instruction.  It's not as easy as you think."""
