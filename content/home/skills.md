  description = """I was fortunate to gain insights into tactical education from observing thousands of cadets use Follow Me and Virtual Battlespace at West Point.  Most organizations understand the benefits of using games but struggle to define their requirements.  With my experience I can guide any organization in implementing and integrating games into their program of instruction.  It's not as easy as you think."""

  description = """Drawing pretty graphics on a map or reciting Clausewitz from memory does not make you a tactician.  The most important aspect to learning tactics is understanding the decisions you make and why you made them.  I do not teach my students what to think I teach them how to think.  Quality practice plus expert instruction is how we begin to raise competent tactical decision-makers.  I can help you develop a program with the right content that is interesting, relevant, and above all useful."""
