  description = "In 2011 I worked as a mentor to the Afghan Uniformed Police (AUP).  I served with three different US Army Brigade Task Forces training and mentoring a unit of 10-13 AUP.  I participated in over 100 foot patrols and an equal number of vehicle patrols observing, coaching, and mentoring my police unit.  Back at the FOB I did several blocks of instruction on patrolling, first aid, marksmanship, and leadership.  In addition to my police unit I also trained and mentored 5 officers, 15 NCOs, and 50 enlisted police officers at three different police checkpoints."

  description = """In 2013 after two years in Afghanistan I took a job with Alion as a Senior Curriculum Developer at the Land forces Academy in Odesa Ukraine.  While at the academy I gained the trust and confidence of the staff and faculty and was able to gain more teaching hours than was previously allowed.  I taught a NATO-based curriculum suitable for PME 1-3 level students.  I used the game Follow Me which is the same game we used at West Point and the one I helped develop.  In February 2014 I created a block of instruction for the Captains Advance Course and was given permission to teach it as well.  It was a great success with a lot of positive feedback from the students."""
