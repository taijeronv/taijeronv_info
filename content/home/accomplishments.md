I developed a program of instruction for 3rd and 4th-year cadets that I also taught.  The focus was on small unit tactics at the platoon level. I taught them NATO symbols, terminology, and the principles of offensive and defensive platoon operations. 

I also implemented the Follow Me computer game which gave them the opportunity to practice making decisions in an operational environment. """

In 2006 I collaborated with the creator of Decisive Action to create a platoon level game called Follow Me. 

I integrated Follow Me into the DMI tactics curriculum, and we used it to provide a realistic operational environment to make platoon level tactical
decisions. We were so successful that other departments wanted to use it for some of their entry-level leadership classes.  

I was also instrumental in integrating Virtual Battle Space  (VBS) into the 2007 Cadet Basic Training.  We used it as an introduction to squad fire and movement. The intent was to provide them with an experiential learning experience before they went to the field. """

One of my most significant achievements was to assist in the development of a division-level staff exercise that used Decisive Action and TacOps.  

The Digital Division staff group was supposed to use JCATS, but for some reason, it was not available.

The college turned to the sims team for support. We worked very closely with the [Functional Area 57's](https://www.csiac.org/certification/u-s-army-functional-area-57-fa57/) Army officers that specialize in simulations and modeling to design the  
exercise.

We uses Decisive Action for most of the operations and I recommended TacOps for select brigade operations. I created most of the content for both games maps, unit database, and set up the game.  

We had the division staff group, three brigade staffs, and some students helping to "play" the game. Our sims team successfully supported a major exercise using nothing more than two games worth about $70 total.

The exercise was such a success that by the time I left in 2004, Decisive Action had become the primary simulation for 16 individual division staff exercises. """
