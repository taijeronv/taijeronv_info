I served for seven months in Eastern Ukraine, patrolling non-government
controlled areas. On one occasion, I participated in a patrol that spent the
night in Shirokyne, a highly contested town by both sides. 

Our mission was to determine the feasibility of conducting 24-hour operations in
the conflict zone. The patrol was a success, but we never got permission to do
it again.

I developed a program for 3rd and 4th-year cadets that I also taught.
The focus was on small unit tactics at the platoon level. I taught them NATO
symbols, terminology, and the principles of offensive and defensive platoon
operations. I used Follow Me the game that I co-developed at West Point, which
enabled them to execute their plans in an immersive and dynamic operational
environment. 

The cadets told me they got more out of using the game than they
did in their usual lessons. They could see their units performing and determine
where they made mistakes. The faculty was so impressed they wanted me to develop
additional classes and expand my program of instruction."""

I mentored a small unit of 10 Afghan Police in Khowst province who were
attached to a US Army brigade. 
  
One of my projects was to develop a two-week orientation course that taught
the police how to operate with US Army units. Among other things, they learned
first aid, battle drills, terminology, and planning. 

All of the members successfully completed the course. They were very
enthusiastic about the training and said it helped them understand what was
going on while on patrol, which was my intent. """

In 2006 I was asked by the head of the Department of Military Instruction
(DMI) to find a game that we could use as a tool to teach tactics. Follow Me
was the result of that search. I contacted the creator of Decisive Action, and
together we collaborated on Follow Me. Decisive Action is the game that I used
at the Command and General Staff College.

I integrated Follow Me into the DMI tactics curriculum, and we used it to
provide a realistic operational environment to make platoon level tactical
decisions. We were so successful that other departments wanted to use it for
some of their entry-level leadership classes.  

Around the same time, I was developing Follow Me, I was also instrumental in
bringing Virtual Battlespace 2 (VBS2) to the academy as a beta test site. In
2007 over 1000 cadets used VBS2 during Cadet Basic Training as an introduction
to squad fire and movement. The intent was to provide them with a classroom
learning experience before they went to the field. The feedback from the
department was excellent, and VBS2 has used in different ways ever since. """

One of my most significant achievements was to assist in the development of a
division-level staff exercise that used Decisive Action and TacOps.  

The Digital Division staff group was supposed to use JCATS, but for some reason,
it was not available.

The college turned to the sims team for support. We worked very closely with the
[Functional Area 57's](https://www.csiac.org/certification/u-s-army-functional-area-57-fa57/)
Army officers that specialize in simulations and modeling to design the  
exercise.

We uses Decisive Action for most of the operations and I recommended TacOps for
select brigade operations. I created most of the content for both games maps,
unit database, and set up the game.  

We had the division staff group, three brigade staffs, and some students helping
to "play" the game. Our sims team successfully supported a major exercise using
nothing more than two games worth about $70 total.

The exercise was such a success that by the time I left in 2004, Decisive Action had
become the primary simulation for 16 individual division staff exercises. """
