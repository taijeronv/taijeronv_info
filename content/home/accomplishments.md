I developed and taught a program of instruction for the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th-year cadets.  The the goal of the program was to famliarize them with how NATO infantry platoons operate.  I taught them battle drills, NATO symbols, and terminology.

I also implemented the Follow Me computer game which gave them the opportunity to practice making decisions in an operational environment.  I was so successful that one of the instructors offered me some of his class time for additional instruction. """

In 2006 I collaborated with the creator of Decisive Action to create a platoon level game called Follow Me.

I integrated Follow Me into the DMI tactics curriculum, and we used it to provide a realistic operational environment for platoon level tactical
decisions. Our 3rd and 4th year military science classes all used Follow Me to practice infantry platoon-level decision making.  I also used it to run a brigade-level exercise for the Defense Strategic Studies program.  Not only did we use the computer game but we also implemented role-playing for certain events like key leader engagements.

I also integrated the use Virtual Battle Space (VBS) into Cadet Basic Training.  We used it as an introduction to squad fire and movement. The intent was to provide them with an experiential learning experience before they went to the field."""

One of my most significant achievements was to assist in the development of a division-level staff exercise that used Decisive Action and TacOps.

The Digital Division staff group was supposed to use JCATS, but for some reason, it was not available.

The college turned to the sims team for support. We worked very closely with the [Functional Area 57's](https://www.csiac.org/certification/u-s-army-functional-area-57-fa57/) Army officers that specialize in simulations and modeling to design the exercise.

I was reponsible for creating the scenario, unit database, maps and terrain coding, and I also ran the game during the exercise.  At my recommendation we used another game called TacOps to execute some of the brigade-level operations.  I was also reponsible for developing the TacOps content.

We had the division staff group, three brigade staffs, and some students helping to "play" the game.

The exercise was such a success that by the time I left in 2004, Decisive Action had become the primary simulation for 16 separate division-staff exercises. """
