I turned to the developer of Decisive Action and together we designed a game called Follow Me that could be used to teach light infantry tactics.  For the next five years I implemented that game in a number of different courses.  By the time I left West Point in 2011 I had educated more than 10,000 cadets using Follow Me."""
