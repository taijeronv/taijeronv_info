I developed and taught a program of instruction for the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th-year cadets.  The goal of the program was to famliarize them with how NATO infantry platoons operate.  I taught them battle drills, NATO symbols, planning, and tactics.

I also implemented the Follow Me computer game, which allowed them to practice making decisions in an operational environment. Needless to say, this was a big hit with the cadets. For the first time, they had an opportunity to "lead" a platoon while dealing with an active enemy. """

I integrated the game Virtual Battlespace (VBS) into Cadet Basic Training. We used it as an introduction to squad fire and movement techniques. The intent was to provide them with an experiential learning experience before they went to the field. Cadets were taught the role of each squad member and got the opportunity to practice moving, shooting, and communicating in a 3d virtual environment.   I also crearted VBS content scenarios, scripts, and set up multi-player games for cadets to practice giving verbal orders and commands.

In 2006 I collaborated with the creator of Decisive Action to develop a platoon level game called Follow Me.  I integrated Follow Me into the DMI tactics curriculum, and we used it to provide a realistic operational environment for making platoon level tactical decisions. More than 2000 cadets in our 3rd and 4th-year military science program used Follow Me to practice infantry platoon tactics. 

In my time at West Point, I literally trained thousands of cadets using Virtual Battlespace, Follow Me and the Engagement Skills Trainer."""

One of my most significant achievements was to assist in the development of a division-level staff exercise that used Decisive Action and TacOps.

The Digital Division staff group's JCATS exercise the college turned to the DLDC Sims-TM for support.

Our team worked very closely with the Functional Area 57's Army officers that specialize in simulations and modeling to design the exercise.

I was responsible for creating the scenario, unit database, maps and terrain coding, for Decisive Action, and another game called TacOpsCav. We used TacOpsCav to execute some of the brigade-level operations. 

The scenario we created was a non-contiguous area of operations with several factions that represented different insurgent groups.

In total, we had one division and three brigade staff groups.

The exercise was a big success. By the time I left in 2004, Decisive Action had become the primary simulation for 16 separate division-staff exercises.  """
