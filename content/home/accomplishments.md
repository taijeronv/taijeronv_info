When I first arrived at the academy, the staff and faculty were a bit skeptical
about my presence there. I eventually gained the trust of one of the senior
instructors who also happened to be my biggest opponent. I was there for a short
time, but I made the most of it. I developed a program that I taught to 1st
through 4th-year cadets. The focus was on small unit tactics at the platoon
level. They learned NATO symbols, terminology, and the principles of offensive
and defensive operations. What made it better is that I used Follow Me the game
that I co-developed while at West Point, which enabled them to execute their
plans in an immersive and dynamic operational environment."""

  I had a great to mentor a small unit of Afghan Police in the Khowst province
  starting in 2011. I conducted training in first aid, site security,
  patrolling, tactics, and a myriad of other tasks. I participated in several
  patrols with them and could see they were applying what they'd been taught.

  In 2005 I was asked by the head of the Department of Military Instruction to
  find a game that we could use as a tool to teach tactics. Follow Me was the
  result of that search. I co-developed it with the creator of Decisive Action a
  game that's been used at the Command and General Staff College since 2001. I
  helped the department integrate Follow Me into the curriculum and we used it
  to provide a realistic environment for the cadets to make platoon level
  decisions in a tactical environment. We were so successful that other
  departments wanted to use it for some of their entry level leadership
  classes."""

  I believe I had a huge impact while serving as a sims specialist at the
  Command and General Staff College. After more than 18 years the college
  continues to use Decisive Action. DA was a program that I helped integrate
  into the staff officers course. At the time I was the only DA expert in the
  entire world. Yes, entire world. Why? Mainly because I had been playing it
  several months before I was hired to integrate it into the course. Decisive
  Action is a commerical off the shelf game that was made available in 2001
  before it was used in the college. I played it and even wrote a small guide to
  use it. My experience with the game is why I was hired. One of my biggest
  achievements was to use Decisive Action and TacOpsCav to run a division level.
  The exercise was for the "Digital Division" and was supposed to use JCATS but
  for some reason it was canned. The college turned to us to provide this one
  staff group an exercise. As the primary DA guy, and TacOps for that matter, I
  developed the unit database, "cut" and coded the maps, and setup both games.
  It was a great success and we demonstrated how a game could replace a "real
  sim" to support the college. In about a year or two the college turned
  entirely to DA for their end of course capstone exercise. """
