I served for seven months in Eastern Ukraine in a hostile kinetic environment. I
participated in several patrols, and one occasion spent the night in
non-government controlled Shirokyne. Even to this day, I do not think that's
ever been done. Our mission was to determine the feasibility of conducting
24-hour operations in non-government controlled areas. Our mission was a
success, but it was never repeated. 

In 2015 I was redeployed to the Odesa
Monitoring Team. I've been a one-man Operations cell for over four years. I've
planned several team level operations massive crowd demonstrations. The biggest
impact I've made is to apply my military experience to our daily operations. In
addition to planning, I also serve as acting team leader when necessary, manage
the personalities in the office, and make sure things get done."""

When I first arrived at the academy, the staff and faculty were a bit skeptical
about my presence there. In the beginning, one of the senior instructors was
very vocal about my teaching. After a couple months, he became my biggest
supporter. I developed a program that I taught to 1st through 4th-year cadets.
The focus was on small unit tactics at the platoon level. The cadets learned
NATO symbols, terminology, and the principles of offensive and defensive
operations. 

I used Follow Me the game that I co-developed at West Point, which
enabled them to execute their plans in an immersive and dynamic operational
environment. The cadets told me they got more out of using the game than they
did in any other lesson. They said they could see their units performing and
determine where they made mistakes. The faculty was so impressed they wanted me
to develop additional classes and expand my program of instruction."""

  I mentored a small unit of 10 Afghan Police in Khowst province. During my time
  there, I served with three different US Army units. They were thankful that I
  was there to provide training to the police, which allowed them to do other
  things. 
  
  I eventually developed a two-week induction course intended to orient
  them on how US Army units operate. The intent was to develop skills they would
  need to operate with the US Army, for example, first aid, battle drills,
  terminology, and planning. I put all members of the unit through the course.
  They were very enthusiastic about the content and said it was beneficial to
  them and gave them an idea of what was going on when they were on patrol. """

  In 2006 I was asked by the head of the Department of Military Instruction to
  find a game that we could use as a tool to teach tactics. Follow Me was the
  result of that search. 
  
  I co-developed it with the creator of Decisive Action, a game that I used at
  the Command and General Staff College. I helped the department integrate
  Follow Me into the curriculum, and we used it to provide a realistic
  operational environment for the cadets to make platoon level decisions. We
  were so successful that other departments wanted to use it for some of their
  entry-level leadership classes. 
  
  Around the same time, I made an agreement to beta test Virtual Battlespace 2.
  In 2007 we integrated it into Cadet Basic Training. Over 1000 cadets used VBS2
  as an introduction to squad tactics. The intent was to provide them with an
  experiential learning experience before they went to the field. The feedback
  from the department was excellent. """

  One of my most significant achievements was to develop the content for
  Decisive Action and TacOpsCav to run a division-level staff exercise. The
  Digital Division staff group was supposed to use JCATS as the exercise driver
  for their end of year capstone exercise, but for some reason, JCATS was not
  available. The college turned to the sims team for support. 
  
  While the other staff groups did the "Prairie Warrior" exercise, we used two
  commercial games, Decisive Action, and TacOps to drive the Digital Division
  staff exercise. I suggested we use Decisive Action for the major operations
  and TacOps for selected smaller unit operations. It worked great. Because of
  the way the games work, all the students were actively engaged in the
  exercise, not just sitting around doing nothing.
  
  Our sims team proved that we could run a serious exercise using a $40 game. By
  the time I left in 2004, the end of year capstone exercise had consisted of 16
  individual staff exercises, all of them driven by Decisive Action. """
