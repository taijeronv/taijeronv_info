Originally from the [Island of Guam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guam), I
joined the U.S. Army in 1981 at the age of 17. In 2001 I transitioned from the
Army to civilian life after 20 years in boots. Since my retirement I've been on
a journey that's taken me around the world eventually landing in Odesa Ukraine
where I've been living since 2013.

Hi my name is TJ and I am someone you want on your team.  My specialty is in military training and education but I can operate just about anywhere.  If you need someone who is professional, competent and reliable look no further.  

I'm currently serving as the Team Operations Officer for the Odesa Monitoring
Team, which is part of the [OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine](https://www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine).

I have a keen interest in web technology which is why <a href="post/taijeronv-info">I created this website</a>.  

Here's the concept paper for my passion project <a href="post/ngw_concept">NextGen
Wargame</a>.  For a more <a href= "post/ngwargame">detailed read</a>  on why I think we need a program like NextGen Wargame.
