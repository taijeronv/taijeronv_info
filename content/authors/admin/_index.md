Originally from the [Island of Guam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guam), I
joined the U.S. Army in 1981 at the age of 17. In 2001 after 20 years in the
Army, I decided to transition to the civilian sector. In November 2001 I started a
fantastic journey that would take me around the world and eventually to Odesa
Ukraine.

- Monitoring the ongoing conflict in the [Donbass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donbass) (Eastern Ukraine).
- Teaching at the
  [Odesa Military Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odessa_Military_Academy)
  in Odesa.
- Mentoring the Afghan Uniformed Police in Khowst Province, Afghanistan.
- Teaching cadets tactical decision-making at
  [The United States Military Academy](https://www.westpoint.edu/military/department-of-military-instruction/simulation-center) at West Point, New York.
- Integrating [Decisive Action](http://decisive-point.com/decisive-action/) into
  the curriculum at the
  [Command and General Staff College](https://usacac.army.mil/organizations/cace/cgsc) at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

## So what? Tell me what you've been doing lately

{{< figure src="/img/shirokyne.jpg" caption="Members of the Azov Volunteer Battalion watch as we plan an ad-hoc mission into non-government controlled Shirokyne." >}}
I am currently serving as the Team Operations Officer for the Odesa Monitoring
Team, which is part of the [OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine](https://www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine). The
[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)](https://www.osce.org/whatistheosce/factsheet) consists of 57 member
states in North America, Europe, and Asia. It is the world's largest
regional security organization.  

Our mission is to observe and report impartially and objectively on the
situation in Ukraine.

OSCE has a rule that limits being in one mission for seven years my time will be up in 2021.

## Have skills, will travel
Rather than wait until my seven year mark I would like to prepare myself now and
begin my transition as soon as possible.

**Objectives**
- I'm seeking a full or part-time opportunity with a professional company that
  will appreciate my years of experience and value my professionalism.
- I believe my skills will work in other industries even though they are
  concentrated in the military domain (training, education and operations).
- I am willing to relocate to the US, Europe, Middle East, Africa, or
  conflict-zone if necessary. If relocating isn't necessary I can
  work remotely or part time depending on the job.

## Why you should hire me
Professional, competent, and reliable.

Have you ever been in an organization where there was this one guy that always
got things done? He shows up and all of a sudden, all your fears are gone
because you know he's going to take care of everything.

**I'm that guy.**

My current boss describes me as his safety net. He knows that I can run the team
in his absence, manage the different personalities in the office, and get
things done. Professional, competent, and reliable.

## Goals
I have a number of personal and professional goals that I would like to
accomplish in the next five years.

### Personal Goals
- In one year I'd like take my Russian to a B2 level.
- In three months I would like to complete the software requirements and rules
  for my passion project NextGen Wargame (NGW).
- In nine months, I would like to have a playable demo.
- In 18 months, I would like to have a minimum viable product (MVP) that I can
  shop around to interested company's.

What I'd really like is for a company to take an interest in my project and hire
me to get it off the ground. 

### Professional Goals  
- In six months I want to complete a course on User Interface Design.  
- In one year I would like to complete a course on Frontend Development.  
- In 3-5 years I would like to be leading my own development team creating games
  for education and training.
  
## My passion project
The NextGen Wargame is a project that I started on my own initiative because I love
wargames and designing one was a natural "next step" for me.  

A properly designed computer wargame that places the student in a dynamic
operational development provides a whole new learning opportunity.

What better way to add an exciting and interesting way to learn tactical
decision-making and problem-solving.

The NextGen Wargame is designed to be that tool.
