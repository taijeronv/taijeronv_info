I'm originally from the Island of Guam and joined the Army at the age of 17.
After 20 years in boots I started the next chapter of my adventure which is
arguably the most exciting and colorful. I've been a soldier, simulations specialist, police
mentor, international Monitor, traveling the world over with a wide range of experiences.  

I am currently serving as the Team Operations Officer for an international team
of monitors in the city of Odesa, Ukraine. I plan operations, manage assets and
personnel, and I monitor the military domain in accordance with our mandate.

My goal is to get back into the "game" in a position that allows me to use my
extensive experience using games for training and eduction. My desire is to be
based in Europe but I have no problem going wherever I'm needed.
