Originally from the Island of Guam I joined the Army in 1981 at the age of 17.
In 2001 after 20 years in the Army I decided to start the next chapter of my
life. Since my transition I've had a variety of jobs most in the area of
military training and education, at the Command and General Staff College, West
Point, and in Afghanistan.

I am currently serving as the Team Operations Officer for an international team
of monitors in the city of Odesa, Ukraine. I plan operations, manage assets and
personnel, and I monitor the military/security situation in accordance with our mandate.

After five years in the Organization for Security and Operation in Europe I am
ready to move back to the doing what I love which is military training and  
education.

Even though I've been away from the training and education domain I have not
been idle. I believe I have a unique combination of skills as a consumer of
games, teacher, curriculum developer, and game developer. In most cases you may
find someone with experience in one or two of these areas, but in my case I've
almost "done it all."

So what have I been doing while on break from training and education? I am
currently working on my own project which is a web-based wargame designed
specifically for training and education. I believe this is a unique way to
deliver such a game and has the potential to reach the most users.


The NextGen Wargame is just the beginning. I also plan to develop a basic
package of content that will focus on the undergrad level of PME. The whole
system will be web based and accessible from anywhere in the world as long as
there's an internet connection.
