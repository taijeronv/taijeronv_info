Originally from the [Island of Guam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guam), I joined the U.S. Army in 1981 at the age of 17.
In 2001 after 20 years in the Army, I decided to start the next chapter of my
life.  Since then, I've had a variety of unique and exciting jobs:

- Monitoring the ongoing conflict in Eastern Ukraine.
- Teaching at the
  [Odesa Military Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odessa_Military_Academy)
  in Odesa Ukraine.
- Mentoring the Afghan Uniformed Police in Khowst Province, Afghanistan.
- Teaching cadets tactical decision-making at
  [West Point](https://www.westpoint.edu/military/department-of-military-instruction/simulation-center)
  the premiere military academy in the United States.
- Integrating [Decisive Action](http://decisive-point.com/decisive-action/) into
  the curriculum at the
  [Command and General Staff College](https://usacac.army.mil/organizations/cace/cgsc).

### What have I been doing?

{{< figure src="/img/shirokyne.jpg" caption="Members of the Azov Volunteer Battalion watch as we plan an ad-hoc mission into non-government controlled Shirokyne." >}}
I am currently serving as the Team Operations Officer for the Odesa Monitoring
Team, which is part of the [OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine](https://www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine). The
[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)](https://www.osce.org/whatistheosce/factsheet) consists of 57 member
states in North America, Europe, and Asia. It is the world's largest
regional security organization.  The OSCE SMMU is tasked to observe and report impartially and objectively on the situation in Ukraine.

### Have skills, will travel
In OSCE there is a time limit on how long you can stay.  For example you cannot stay in the same mission for more than seven years.  This is my current situation.  I have until September 2021 at which point I will hit my seven year mark.

Rather than wait until the last minute I would like to start transitioning immediately.

**Job Goals**
- Although my skillset is strongest in the military domain (education, training,
  or operating) I am open to working in another sector.
- At the moment I am expanding my skillet to include programming
  (Javascript/Python) although it would take me more time to become productive
  as a coder.

**Location**
- If I could work remotely from Ukraine that would be the best situation. I know
  that it's unlikely but If I had to make a wish this would be one of them.
- The second best option would be to "base" out of Ukraine for example if I was
  a trainer. I could "deploy" from Ukraine to wherever the training was taking
  place.
- Third would be to work in Europe or the US.

**The bottomline is, I will go wherever I'm needed.**

### Why should I hire you?
I can give you a million reasons why but you will never know until you hire me.

Professional, competent, and reliable. These are the three reasons why you
should hire me. There are a whole slew of other things as well but it's these
three that I take pride in the most. Have you ever been in an organization where
there was this one guy that had a calming effect? You know what I'm talking
about, someone who shows up and all of a sudden all your fears are gone because
you know he's going to make sure things get done. I'm that guy.

My current boss describes me as his safety net. He knows that I can run the team
in his absence, manage all the different personalities in the office, and get
things done.

### What am I working on?
[The NextGen Wargame](https://friendly-ritchie-374adc.netlify.com/) I believe we
can improve the quality of military education by using computer wargames as a
tool to add a dynamic operational environment for the student to practice in.
The NextGen Wargame is designed specifically for use in the classroom or
simulations center. I started this project on my own initiative because I love
wargames and designing one was a natural "next step" for me.
