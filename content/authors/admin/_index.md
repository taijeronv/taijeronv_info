Originally from the Island of Guam, I joined the Army at the age of 17. I spent
over 20 years. Soldier, simulations specialist, police mentor, international
monitor I've had a very colorful and varied adventure all over the world. I've
gained skills and experience that make me an asset wherever I go.

I am currently serving as the Team Operations Officer for an international team
of monitors in the city of Odesa, Ukraine. I plan operations, manage assets and
personnel, and I monitor the military domain in accordance with our mandate.

When I retired from the Army in 2001 I became a simulation specialist working
for Northrop Grumman at the Command and General Staff College as part of the
Digital Leader Development Course. I was the main integrator for a game called
Decisive Action which is a commercial off the shelf game at the Corp and
Division level. By the time I left CGSC we were running 16 division staff
exercises using Decisive Action and had totally replaced the multi-million
dollar capstone exercise Prairie Warrior.

In 2004 I was hired by the United States Military Academy or West Point to be
the first manager for the Warfighting Simulation Center now called the
Simulation Center. West Point is the premier military academy in the country. In
2006 I was tasked by the head of the Department for Military Instruction to find
a game that could be integrated into the tactics curriculum. I turned to the
developer of Decisive Action for a platoon level game that could be used to
teach light infantry dismounted tactics.
