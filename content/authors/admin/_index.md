I'm originally from the Island of Guam and joined the Army at the age of 17.
After 20 years in boots I started the next chapter of my adventure which is
arguably the most exciting and colorful. I've been a soldier, simulations specialist, police
mentor, international Monitor, traveling the world over with a wide range of experiences.  

I am currently serving as the Team Operations Officer for an international team
of monitors in the city of Odesa, Ukraine. I plan operations, manage assets and
personnel, and I monitor the military domain in accordance with our mandate.

I am very interested in getting back to the training and education specialty,
this is where my passion lies. Ideally I could base out of Europe but I would go
wherever I'm needed.

I am currently working on my own project which is a web-based wargame designed
specifically for training and education. I believe the web is the fastest way to
get a game in the hands of users. From a software management perspective it is
also the easiest way to update and maintain. My focus at the moment is on
requirements and writing the rules. I plan to spend my own money to fund the
development of the game in manageable stages. If I'm lucky a company may hire me
and provide the resources to hasten its development.

The NextGen Wargame is just the beginning. I also plan to develop a basic
package of content that will focus on the undergrad level of PME. The whole
system will be web based and accessible from anywhere in the world as long as
there's an internet connection.
