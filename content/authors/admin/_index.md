Originally from the [Island of Guam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guam), I joined the Army in 1981 at the age of 17.
In 2001 after 20 years in the Army, I decided to start the next chapter of my
life.  Since then, I've had a variety of unique and exciting jobs:

- Monitoring the ongoing conflict in Eastern Ukraine.
- Teaching at the [Odesa Military Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odessa_Military_Academy) in Odesa Ukraine
- Mentoring the Afghan Uniformed Police in Khowst Province, Afghanistan
- Teaching cadets tactical decision-making at [West Point](https://www.westpoint.edu/military/department-of-military-instruction/simulation-center) the premiere military academy in the United States.
- Integrating [Decisive Action](http://decisive-point.com/decisive-action/) into the curriculum at the Command and General Staff College

### What have I been doing?
I am currently serving as the Team Operations Officer for the Odesa Monitoring
Team, which is part of the [OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine](https://www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine). The
[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)](https://www.osce.org/whatistheosce/factsheet) consists of 57 member
states in North America, Europe, and Asia. It is the world's largest
regional security organization.  The OSCE SMMU is tasked to observe and report impartially and objectively on the situation in Ukraine.

### What am I looking for?
I want to transition back to what I love most, which is training and education. 

I have less than 24 months left with OSCE, but I feel that it would be better to
transition now rather than wait until the last minute. With that in mind, I am actively
looking for my next job.

Although my goal is to get back to simulations and gaming, I believe I have the
skills to operate in any capacity that requires planning, execution, and
leadership.

### So what makes me unique?
I've put one of my skills on display with this website. Even though I'm not a
"webmaster," I have enough technical expertise to figure things out and do what I
need. Whether it's programming in Javascript/Python, writing in markdown, or
troubleshooting my home network. 

Regarding simulations and gaming, I believe I have a solid set of skills
and experience that make me unique among applicants.
- I've been playing commercial wargames such as TacOps, Command Ops, and Combat
  Mission for over 40 years.
- I have extensive teaching experience using games in the classroom such as
  [Follow Me](http://decisive-point.com/follow-me/) and
  [Virtual Battlespace 2](https://bisimulations.com/products/vbs3). Keep in mind
  I've put whole West Point classes (up to 1000 Cadets) through cadet basic
  training using VBS2, as well as running capstone exercises for 4th-year cadets
  using Follow Me. Not to mention the work I've done with 2nd and 3rd year
  cadets supporting individual instructors. That's several thousand cadets.
- In CGSC, I was the primary integrator of Decisive Action, which has been used
  by the college for 18 years.
- I also collaborated on the development of a game called Follow Me, which was
  designed specifically for use in the classroom. I wrote the requirements and
  validated the final product.

### What am I working on?
[The NextGen Wargame](https://friendly-ritchie-374adc.netlify.com/) is my
passion project. Imagine a game suitable for use in the classroom but delivered
over the internet and playable inside a browser. All the game's content is on
one website, such as lessons, instructor notes, AAR files, Opords, maps and unit
images. All in a self-contained package delivered over the net.

## This is my vision for the NextGen Wargame.
