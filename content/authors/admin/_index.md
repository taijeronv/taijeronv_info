Hello and welcome to my personal website.  If you have any questions please feel free to [drop me a line](mailto:vincent.taijeron@gmail.com).

### Things you should know:
- My name is Vincent but for over 38 years I've been called "TJ."
- I'm originally from the beautiful [Island of Guam.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guam)
- I joined the US Army when I was 17 years-old and spent my career as a [RedLeg](http://www.abtryassoc.org/misc_pages/redlegs.html) in the Field Artillery.
- In 2013 I came to Ukraine to teach at the Odessa Military Academy and I've been working and living here ever since.

### What I've been doing:
I am currently serving as the Team Operations Officer for the Odessa Monitoring Team, which is part of the [OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine](https://www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine). The [Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)](https://www.osce.org/whatistheosce/factsheet) consists of 57 member states in North America, Europe, and Asia. It is the world's largest regional security organization.
