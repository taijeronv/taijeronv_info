Originally from the [Island of Guam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guam), I
joined the U.S. Army in 1981 at the age of 17. In 2001 after 20 years in the
Army, I decided to transition to the civilian sector. In November 2001 I started a
fantastic journey that would take me around the world and eventually to Odesa
Ukraine.

- Monitoring the ongoing conflict in the [Donbass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donbass) (Eastern Ukraine).
- Teaching at the
  [Odesa Military Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odessa_Military_Academy)
  in Odesa.
- Mentoring the Afghan Uniformed Police in Khowst Province, Afghanistan.
- Teaching cadets tactical decision-making at
  [The United States Military Academy](https://www.westpoint.edu/military/department-of-military-instruction/simulation-center) at West Point, New York.
- Integrating [Decisive Action](http://decisive-point.com/decisive-action/) into
  the curriculum at the
  [Command and General Staff College](https://usacac.army.mil/organizations/cace/cgsc) at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

## So what? Tell me what you've been doing lately

{{< figure src="/img/shirokyne.jpg" caption="Members of the Azov Volunteer Battalion watch as we plan an ad-hoc mission into non-government controlled Shirokyne." >}}
I am currently serving as the Team Operations Officer for the Odesa Monitoring
Team, which is part of the [OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine](https://www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine). The
[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)](https://www.osce.org/whatistheosce/factsheet) consists of 57 member
states in North America, Europe, and Asia. It is the world's largest
regional security organization.  

The OSCE SMMU is tasked to observe and report impartially and objectively on the
situation in Ukraine.

In OSCE, there is a time limit on how long you can stay. For example, you cannot
remain on the same mission for more than seven years. I have until September
2021 at which point I will hit my seven-year mark and must resign from OSCE.

## Have skills, will travel
I do not want wait until my seven year mark I would like to prepare myself now and
begin my transition.

**Objectives**
- I'm seeking a full or part time opportunity with a professional company that will
  utilize my many years of experience in their day to day operations.
- I'm an obvious fit for the military sector (training, education, or
  operations). I believe my skills will work in other sectors as well. Drop me a
  line and we can discuss it.
- I am willing to relocate to the US, Europe, Middle East, Africa, or
  conflict-zone if necessary. If relocating isn't necessary I can
  work remotely or part time depending on the job.

## Why you should hire me
Professional, competent, and reliable.

Have you ever been in an organization where there was this one guy that had a
calming effect? You know what I'm talking about, someone who shows up, and all
of a sudden, all your fears are gone because you know he's going to take care of
everything.

### I'm that guy.
My current boss describes me as his safety net. He knows that I can run the team
in his absence, manage the different personalities in the office, and get
things done. Professional, competent, and reliable.

## Goals
I have a number of personal and professional goals that I would like to accomplish in the next five years.

### Personal Goals
- In three months I would like to complete the software requirements and rules for my passion project NextGen Wargame (NGW)
- In nine months I would like to have a playable demo.
- In 18 months I would like to have a minimum viable product (MVP) that I can shop around to interested company's.

### Professional Goals  
I've always been interested in programming and creating software as a hobbyist
but I think it's time to take these skills to a more professional level.

I understand that I will need experience which is why I intend to complete the
courses then volunteer doing pro bono work on a community project or for a small company.
This is how I will build my portfolio of real world projects and gain some
experience. Will it be enough? I don't know but I will enjoy it and the
experience will be invaluable.

The best part about learning these skills is that I can apply them to the NextGen
Wargame.

- In six months I want to complete a course on User Interface Design.  
- In 18 months I'd like to complete a course on Javascript or Python.
- In five years I would like to be managing the development of the NextGen
  Wargame full time and see it in the hands of students and cadets.
  
## My passion project
The NextGen Wargame is a project that I started on my own initiative because I love
wargames and designing one was a natural "next step" for me.  

I believe we can improve the quality of military education by using computer
wargames as a tool to add a dynamic operational environment for the student to
practice in. The NextGen Wargame is designed to be that tool.
