Originally from the [Island of Guam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guam), I
joined the U.S. Army in 1981 at the age of 17. In 2001 after 20 years in the
Army, I decided to transition to the civilian sector. In November 2001 I started a
fantastic journey that would take me around the world and eventually to Odesa
Ukraine.

- Monitoring the ongoing conflict in the [Donbass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donbass) (Eastern Ukraine).
- Teaching at the
  [Odesa Military Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odessa_Military_Academy)
  in Odesa.
- Mentoring the Afghan Uniformed Police in Khowst Province, Afghanistan.
- Teaching cadets tactical decision-making at
  [The United States Military Academy](https://www.westpoint.edu/military/department-of-military-instruction/simulation-center) at West Point, New York.
- Integrating [Decisive Action](http://decisive-point.com/decisive-action/) into
  the curriculum at the
  [Command and General Staff College](https://usacac.army.mil/organizations/cace/cgsc) at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

### What have I been doing?

{{< figure src="/img/shirokyne.jpg" caption="Members of the Azov Volunteer Battalion watch as we plan an ad-hoc mission into non-government controlled Shirokyne." >}}
I am currently serving as the Team Operations Officer for the Odesa Monitoring
Team, which is part of the [OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine](https://www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine). The
[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)](https://www.osce.org/whatistheosce/factsheet) consists of 57 member
states in North America, Europe, and Asia. It is the world's largest
regional security organization.  The OSCE SMMU is tasked to observe and report impartially and objectively on the situation in Ukraine.

### Have skills, will travel
In OSCE, there is a time limit on how long you can stay. For example, you cannot
remain on the same mission for more than seven years. I have until September
2021 at which point I will hit my seven-year mark.

Rather than wait until the last minute, I would like to start my transition as soon
as possible.

**Job Goals**
- Although my skillset is strongest in the military domain (education, training,
  or operating), I am open to working in another job sector.
- I am currently expanding my skill set to include programming
  (Javascript/Python) although it would take me more time to become productive
  as a coder.

**Full or Part Time**
- Full time employment.
- I would consider part time if I could continue to live in Ukraine, but
  deploy to wherever I was needed. For example, if I were in a training job, I
  could live in Ukraine then deploy to the training site when required. The
  reason is the cost of living. I cannot live in the US or other parts
  of Europe if I'm only working part-time it would cost too much.
- Working remotely from home is certainly an option (obviously, this would
  allow me to continue to live in Ukraine).

**Location**
- If the job is fulltime I would happily relocate.
- If the job were part-time the only way to make that work is to continue to
  live in Ukraine for the reasons I stated above.
- The bottom line is I will go wherever I am needed.



### Why should I hire you?
Professional, competent, and reliable. These are the three reasons why I think
you should hire me. 

Have you ever been in an organization where there was this one guy that was rock
solid in everything he does? You know what I'm talking about, someone who shows
up, and all of a sudden, all your fears are gone because you know he's going to
take care of everything. 

**I'm that guy.**

My current boss describes me as his safety net. He knows that I can run the team
in his absence, manage all the different personalities in the office, and get
things done. Professional, competent, and reliable.


### What am I working on?
[The NextGen Wargame](https://friendly-ritchie-374adc.netlify.com/) is a project that I started on my own initiative because I love
wargames and designing one was a natural "next step" for me.  

I believe we can improve the quality of military education by using computer
wargames as a tool to add a dynamic operational environment for the student to
practice in. The NextGen Wargame is designed to be that tool.
