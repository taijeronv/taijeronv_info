Originally from the Island of Guam I joined the Army in 1981 at the age of 17.
In 2001 after 20 years in the Army I decided to start the next chapter of my
life.  Since then I've had a variety unique and interesting jobs:

- Monitoring the ongoing conflict in Eastern Ukraine.
- Teaching at the Land Forces Academy in Odesa Ukraine
- Mentoring the Afghan Uniformed Police in Khowst Province, Afghanistan
- Teaching cadets tactical decision-making at the United States Military Academy
- Running Decisive Action games at Command and General Staff College in support of Division Level Staff Exercises

### What have I been doing?
I am currently serving as the Team Operations Officer for the Odesa Monitoring
Team which is part of the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine. The
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) consists of 57 member
states in North America, Europe, and Asia and is the world's largest
regional security organization.  The OSCE SMMU is tasked to observe and report in an
impartial and objective way on the situation in Ukraine.

### What am I looking for?

I want to transition back to what I love most which is training and education. I
have less than 24 months left with OSCE but I feel that it would be better to
transition now rather than wait until the last minute. With that in mind I am actively
looking for my next interesting job.

Although my goal is to get back to simulations and gaming I believe I have the
skills to operate in any capacity that requires planning, execution, and
leadership.

### So what makes me unique?
I believe I have a unique combination of skills which is why I consider myself very strong in this area:
- I've been playing commercial wargames for over 40 years.
- I've used games in the classroom to educate several thousand cadets.
- I helped develop a game, writing the requirements and validating its functionality.
- I am designing a game. 

### What am I working on?
The NextGen Wargame is my passion project.  Imagine a game suitable for use in the classroom but delivered over the internet and playable inside a browser.  All the content on one website for example lessons, insructors notes, AAR files for studying, etc.  This is my vision for the NextGen Wargame.
