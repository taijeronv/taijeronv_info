Originally from the [Island of Guam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guam), I
joined the U.S. Army in 1981 at the age of 17. In 2001 after 20 years in the
Army, I decided to transition to the civilian sector. In November 2001 I started a
fantastic journey that would take me around the world and eventually to Odesa
Ukraine.

- Monitoring the ongoing conflict in the [Donbass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donbass) (Eastern Ukraine).
- Teaching at the
  [Odesa Military Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odessa_Military_Academy)
  in Odesa.
- Mentoring the Afghan Uniformed Police in Khowst Province, Afghanistan.
- Teaching cadets tactical decision-making at
  [The United States Military Academy](https://www.westpoint.edu/military/department-of-military-instruction/simulation-center) at West Point, New York.
- Integrating [Decisive Action](http://decisive-point.com/decisive-action/) into
  the curriculum at the
  [Command and General Staff College](https://usacac.army.mil/organizations/cace/cgsc) at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

## So what? Tell me what you've been doing lately

{{< figure src="/img/shirokyne.jpg" caption="Members of the Azov Volunteer Battalion watch as we plan an ad-hoc mission into non-government controlled Shirokyne." >}}
I am currently serving as the Team Operations Officer for the Odesa Monitoring
Team, which is part of the [OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine](https://www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine). The
[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)](https://www.osce.org/whatistheosce/factsheet) consists of 57 member
states in North America, Europe, and Asia. It is the world's largest
regional security organization.  

Our mission is to observe and report impartially and objectively on the
situation in Ukraine.

## Have skills, will travel
OSCE has a rule that limits being in one mission for seven years. This means in
2021, I have no choice but to resign from the organization.

Rather than wait until the seven-year time limit, I would like to begin my
transition as soon as possible.

**Objectives**
- I'm seeking a full or part-time opportunity with a professional company that
  will appreciate my years of experience and value my professionalism.
- I believe my skills will work in other industries even though they are
  concentrated in the military domain (training, education and operations).
- I am willing to relocate to the US, Europe, Middle East, Africa, or
  conflict-zone if necessary. 
- If relocating isn't necessary I can work remotely or part time depending on the job.

## Why you should hire me
Professional, competent, and reliable.

Have you ever been in an organization where there was this one guy that always
got things done? You know what I'm talking about, he doesn't need supervision,
always accomplishes his tasks, and does it to a high standard.

**I'm that guy.**

My current boss describes me as his safety net. He knows that I can run the team
in his absence, manage all the personalities in the office, and get
things done. Professional, competent, and reliable.

## Goals
I have a number of personal and professional goals that I would like to
accomplish in the next five years.

### Personal Goals
- In one year I'd like take my Russian to a B2 level.
- In three months I would like to complete the software requirements and rules
  for my passion project NextGen Wargame (NGW).
- In one year, I would like to have a playable demo.
- In 18 months, I would like to have a minimum viable product (MVP).

What I'd really like is for a company to take an interest in my project and hire
me to get it off the ground. 

### Professional Goals  
- In one year complete a course on Web Development and create a product website
  from the ground up.
- In one year complete a course on game development and use the [Phaser Framework](https://phaser.io/phaser3)
  to create the NextGen Wargame playable demo.
- In 3-5 years I would like to be leading my own development team creating games
  for education and training.
  
## My passion project
The NextGen Wargame is a project that I started on my own initiative because I love
wargames and designing one was a natural "next step."  

A properly designed computer wargame that places the student in a dynamic
operational environment provides an interesting and enjoyable way to
learn.

This is my vision for the NextGen Wargame.

Concept:
- The right level of detail, easy to play and understand.
- Playable in a web browser, the operating system does not matter.
- Explicitly designed as an education tool, NOT an exercise driver.
- Designed by someone who plays games, has over 20 years of military experience,
  AND who actually used games in a classroom setting (that's me).

Benefits:
- It enables the student to practice in a dynamic operational environment where
  the enemy, terrain, and weather have an effect.
- Quality practice. The ability to practice in a safe, no-risk environment.  
- Experimentation. Imagine the learning that takes place when a student can
  compare and contrast different courses of action or tactics.
- Critical Analysis (AAR). Ability to watch a "replay" of the operation then
  analyze it step-by-step. What went wrong, and why? What went right, and why?
  What could be done better, and why? Well, you get the picture. WHY is arguably
  the most essential part of learning to think.  

The NextGen Wargame is NOT meant to replace paper-based Tactical Decision Games
(TDGs). It is intended to enhance them and add an "execution" component to go
along with the planning piece. Not only does the student get to plan, but they
also get to execute.
