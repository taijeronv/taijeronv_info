Originally from the [Island of Guam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guam), I
joined the U.S. Army in 1981 at the age of 17. I like doing mind maps,
sometimes I play Eve, and someday I'd like to be a web developer.

Additional Highlights:  
- Seven months monitoring the ongoing conflict in the [Donbass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donbass) (Eastern Ukraine).
- Teaching at the
  [Odesa Military Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odessa_Military_Academy)
  in Ukraine.
- Mentoring the Afghan Uniformed Police in Khowst Province, Afghanistan.
- Teaching cadets tactical decision-making at
  [The United States Military Academy](https://www.westpoint.edu/military/department-of-military-instruction/simulation-center) at West Point, New York.

I am currently serving as the Team Operations Officer for the Odesa Monitoring
Team, which is part of the [OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine](https://www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine).

I really, really, want to break into game development but delivered over the  
internet. I have a passion project called <a href="post/ngwargame/">The NextGen Wargame</a> that I would love
to see in hands of students.

and I created this website using the 
<a href="post/taijeronv-info/">Hugo</a>.
