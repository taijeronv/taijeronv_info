Originally from the Island of Guam I joined the Army in 1981 at the age of 17.
In 2001 after 20 years in the Army I decided to start the next chapter of my
life. Since my transition I've had a variety of jobs:

- International Conflict Monitoring
- Teaching at the Land Forces Academy in Odesa Ukraine
-  Mentoring the Afghan Uniformed Police in Khowst Province, Afghanistan
-  Teaching cadets tactical decision-making at the United States Military Academy
- Running Decisive Action games at Command and General Staff College in support of Division Level Staff Exercises

I am currently serving as the Team Operations Officer for an international team
of monitors in the city of Odesa, Ukraine. I plan operations, manage assets and
personnel, and I monitor the military/security situation in accordance with our
mandate. After five years in the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe I am ready to move back to doing what I love.

I believe I have a unique combination of skills which is why I consider myself very strong in this area:
- I've been playing commercial wargames for over 40 years.
- I've used games in the classroom to educate several thousand cadets.
- I helped develop a game, writing the requirements and validating its functionality.
- I am designing a game. 

The NextGen Wargame is my passion project.  Imagine a game suitable for use in the classroom but delivered over the internet and playable inside a browser.  All the content on one website for example lessons, insructors notes, AAR files for studying, etc.  This is my vision for the NextGen Wargame.
