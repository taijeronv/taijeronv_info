Hi, my name is Vincent, but most people call me "TJ."  I'm Originally from the [Island of Guam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guam).  I joined the US Army at the age of 17, which put me on a journey that's taken me from West Germany to Afghanistan, eventually landing in Odesa Ukraine, where I've been living and working since 2013. 

I am a competent and reliable professional with 15+ years of experience training and educating cadets, soldiers, officers, and non-commissioned officers.  Proven ability to operate effectively in stressful environments.  Recognized by my colleagues for my integrity and professionalism.

I'm currently serving as the Team Operations Officer for the Odesa Monitoring Team, which is part of the [OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine](https://www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine).

I don't know much about web development but that didn't stop me from creating <a href="post/taijeronv-info">this website</a>.

I believe we can improve the  quality of our military science instruction by implementing a tool that provides an operational environment for a student to practice making tactical decisions.  I call it the [NextGen Wargame](https://www.nextgenwargame.com) and it's my passion project.
