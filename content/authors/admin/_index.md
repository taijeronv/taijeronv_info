Hello my name is TJ and I'm originally from the island of Guam. I've done some
time in "boots" which means I spent a little but of time, 20 years in the US
Army.  Don't worry though I'm laid back as ever.

I've been living and working in Ukraine since 2013.

I really, really, want to break into game development but delivered over the  
internet. I have a passion project called the NextGen Wargame that I would love
to see in hands of students.
