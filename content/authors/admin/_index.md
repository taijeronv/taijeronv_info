Originally from the [Island of Guam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guam), I
joined the U.S. Army in 1981 at the age of 17. In 2001 after 20 years in the
Army, I decided to transition to the civilian sector. In November 2001 I started a
fantastic journey that would take me around the world and eventually to Odesa
Ukraine.

- Monitoring the ongoing conflict in the [Donbass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donbass) (Eastern Ukraine).
- Teaching at the
  [Odesa Military Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odessa_Military_Academy)
  in Ukraine.
- Mentoring the Afghan Uniformed Police in Khowst Province, Afghanistan.
- Teaching cadets tactical decision-making at
  [The United States Military Academy](https://www.westpoint.edu/military/department-of-military-instruction/simulation-center) at West Point, New York.
- Integrating [Decisive Action](http://decisive-point.com/decisive-action/) into
  the curriculum at the
  [Command and General Staff College](https://usacac.army.mil/organizations/cace/cgsc) at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

## So what? Tell me what you've been doing lately

{{< figure src="/img/shirokyne.jpg" caption="Members of the Azov Volunteer Battalion watch as we plan an ad-hoc mission into non-government controlled Shirokyne." >}}
I am currently serving as the Team Operations Officer for the Odesa Monitoring
Team, which is part of the [OSCE Special Monitoring Mission to Ukraine](https://www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine). The
[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)](https://www.osce.org/whatistheosce/factsheet) consists of 57 member
states in North America, Europe, and Asia. It is the world's largest
regional security organization.

Our mission is to observe and report impartially and objectively on the
situation in Ukraine.

## Have Skills, Will Travel
OSCE has a rule that limits being in one mission for seven years. This means in
2021, I have no choice but to resign from the organization.

Rather than wait until the seven-year time limit, I would like to begin my
transition as soon as possible.

**Objectives**
- I'm seeking a full or part-time opportunity with a professional company that
  will appreciate my years of experience and value my professionalism.
- I believe my skills will work in other industries even though they are
  concentrated in the military domain (training, education and operations).
- I am willing to relocate to the US, Europe, Middle East, Africa, or
  conflict-zone if necessary.
- If relocating isn't necessary I can work remotely or part time depending on the job.

My CV is available in [HTML](cv/) or [PDF](files/TAIJERON_2019_12_Simulations_Trainer.pdf) (Last updated: December 2019)

## Personal Goals
- In one year complete a course on Web Development and create a product website
  from the ground up.
- In one year complete a course on game development and use the [Phaser Framework](https://phaser.io/phaser3)
  to create the NextGen Wargame playable demo.
- In 3-5 years I would like to be leading my own development team creating games
  for education and training.

## My Passion Project
<a href="post/ngwargame/">The NextGen Wargame</a> is a project that I started on my own initiative because I love
wargames and designing one was a natural "next step."
