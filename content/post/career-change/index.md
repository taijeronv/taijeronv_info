## Caveat
- I still want to work in the military domain
- I don't see it as a "hard" change I see it as another way to contribute to the mil domain
- What I learn in my new career can be used in the mildomain.
  
## Why do you want to change careers?
- Time for a change
- Learn new skills
- Opportunity to work remotely
- Skills apply to my passion project

## What do you want to learn?
- <i class="fab fa-js fa-sm"></i> Javascript
- <i class="fab fa-angular fa-sm"></i> Angular
- <i class="fab fa-html5 fa-sm"></i> HTML5
- <i class="fab fa-css3 fa-sm"></i> CSS3

## How do you intend to learn that stuff
- A little bit at a time
- Udemy courses
- Supplemented by additional online course when necessary

## You don't have any experience
- Not right now but I will
- I will build two sites one for a landscaping company and another for my
  passion project
