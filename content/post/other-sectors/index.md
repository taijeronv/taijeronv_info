I once submitted a job application to the company [Luxsoft](https://career.luxoft.com/about/).  

I did it because the company has offices in the building where I work and I
figured what better way to stay in Odesa Ukraine than to work for Luxsoft. At
the time I didn't have any skills the company was looking for, but I remember
seeing a blurb about submitting an application anyway regardless of your skill
set. So I did.

As expected I never heard from them, it's not their fault I really didn't have
any skill sets they "wanted."

I started thinking what could I possibly offer a tech company with my military
background?

So, here's what I thought. Wouldn't it be cool to be hired to design and
implement a leader development course? I'm almost certain that most large
company's whether they are tech or in some other sector, totally ignore
developing leaders. Sure, they want managers, but that's not the same thing as
being a leader.

## What do you mean by leadership?
Read this article, I think the author explains it perfectly.
[Leadership Legacies Corporate vs Military.](https://www.jetsetmag.com/exclusive/business/leadership-legacies-corporate-military/)
I think it clearly shows some differences between leadership in business and the
military. When I talk about leadership I'm referring to what I learned in the
Army.

## What are you saying TJ?
Don't misunderstand me I do not want to take a bunch of coders and IT people, put
them through boot camp, and turn them into mini-Patton's. What I would like to do
is teach them the [principles of military leadership](https://www.themilitaryleader.com/principles-military-leadership-day-3/) and how to apply them in
their everyday work.  I really believe there's value in those principles.

Leader development is just one way I could contribute to a company.

Here are some more:
- Teach decision making
- Develop a mentor program
- Be a mentor
- Work as a planner
- Teach tactics
