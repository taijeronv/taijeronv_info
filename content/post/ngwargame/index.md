Concept:
- The right level of detail, easy to play and understand.
- Playable in a web browser, the operating system does not matter.
- Explicitly designed as an education tool, NOT an exercise driver.
- Designed by someone who plays games, has over 20 years of military experience,
  AND who actually used games in a classroom setting (that's me).

Benefits:
- It enables the student to practice in a dynamic operational environment where
  the enemy, terrain, and weather have an effect.
- Quality practice. The ability to practice in a safe, no-risk environment.  
- Experimentation. Imagine the learning that takes place when a student can
  compare and contrast different courses of action or tactics.
- Critical Analysis (AAR). Ability to watch a "replay" of the operation then
  analyze it step-by-step. What went wrong, and why? What went right, and why?
  What could be done better, and why? Well, you get the picture. WHY is arguably
  the most essential part of learning to think.  

The NextGen Wargame is NOT meant to replace paper-based Tactical Decision Games
(TDGs). It is intended to enhance them and add an "execution" component to go
along with the planning piece. Not only does the student get to plan, but they
also get to execute.
