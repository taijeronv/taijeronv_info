The NextGen Wargame is a computer game meant to be a learning tool for tactics.  Its purpose is to provide the student an operational enviroment where they can execute their plans. 

- The right level of detail, easy to play and understand.
- Playable in a web browser, the operating system does not matter.
- Specifically designed as an education tool, NOT an exercise driver.
- It is NOT a first-person-shooter nor is it a 3d virtual reality game.

## Why do we need NGW?
In many of the education institutions in the military, the most popular tool for teaching tactics is the Tactical Decision Game (TDG), sometimes called Tactical Decision Exercise (TDE).  

Places like West Point or ROTC use the TDG as a planning exercise.

1. The instructor gives the student a situation and mission. 
2. The student writes an OPORD and a course of action and draws an overlay with the appropriate ops graphics on a map.
3. The instructor grades each of the products and gives the student some feedback. In some cases, the instructor may lead a group discussion using one of the student's solutions.

NGW is not meant to replace the TDG it is meant to bring it to life by offering the student a chance to execute their plan in an operational environment where the enemy, terrain, and weather have an effect.

We need NGW because it provides an experiential learning experience that you cannot get with a paper-based TDG.

## What are some of the benefits to using a computer wargame?
I chose the computer game "format" because it is easy to setup and and offers automatic facilitation.  I love board wargames but I think that in most classroom situations they are not appropriate.

For example if you have 18 students and only 45 minutes for a lesson using a board wargame would be impractical.  To use a board wargame you need an experienced person to be the "rules lawyer" and help keep the game moving along.

Computer wargames have an advantage because the "umpire" is built in and can make the necessary game calculations in miliseconds.  Pluse setting up a game is easy, the player simply selects a scenario and all the playing pieces are put in the correct locations.

- It enables the student to practice in a dynamic operational environment.
- The ability to practice making tactical decisions and solving problems at the appropriate command level.
- Experimentation. Imagine the learning that takes place when a student has the opportunity to compare and contrast different courses of action or tactics.
- Critical Analysis. Ability to watch a "replay" of the operation then analyze it step-by-step. What went wrong or right, and why? 
What could be done differently, and why? The "WHY" is arguably the most essential part of learning to think.
- Meant to develop one's tactical IQ.
