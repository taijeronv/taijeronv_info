In most schoolhouses the Tactical Decision Game is one of the tools used to teach tactics.
The TDG is bascially a planning exercise with no execution piece. 

**How it works**  
1. The instructor gives the student a situation and mission. 
2. The student writes an OPORD and a course of action, and creates an
   overlay with the appropriate ops graphics on a map.
3. The instructor grades each of the products and gives the student some
   feedback. In some cases the instructor may lead a group discussion using one
   of the student's solutions.

The problem as I see it is there's no meaningful execution of the mission. 

- How does the student deal with an enemy that is also trying to impose its will? 
- 1st squad is ambushed moving to their support by fire position, now what? 
- The student observes way more enemy than anticipated, now what?

How does the student practice dealing with unexpected situations in a
paper-based TDG? They can't.

In a paper TDG at what point does the student get the opportunity to "think"
their way out of a problem?

They don't.

## The NextGen Wargame
First of all let's get something straight. The NextGen Wargame is NOT meant to
replace paper-based TDGs. 

The NGW is meant to give the student a "complete" learning experience by adding an execution
piece.

- It enables the student to practice in a dynamic operational environment where
  the enemy, terrain, and weather have an effect.
- The ability to practice in a safe, no-risk environment. Making the right level
  of decisions.
- Experimentation. Imagine the learning that takes place when a student can
  compare and contrast different courses of action or tactics.
- Critical Analysis (AAR). Ability to watch a "replay" of the operation then
  analyze it step-by-step. What went wrong, and why? What went right, and why?
  What could be done better, and why? Well, you get the picture. WHY is arguably
  the most essential part of learning to think.  

### Tell me about the NextGen Wargame
The NextGen Wargame is a computer wargame that can be played in a web browser
and is delivered over the internet. I chose the computer "format" because it's
easier and faster to play than a manual game. Don't get me wrong I think
"analog" games are great but only under the right conditions.

**The NextGen Wargame**
- The right level of detail, easy to play and understand.
- Playable in a web browser, the operating system does not matter.
- Specifically designed as an education tool, NOT an exercise driver.
- Designed by someone who plays games, has over 20 years of military experience,
  AND who actually used games in a classroom setting (that's me).

I should say something about that last point. Just because you're a gamer, or
someone with military experience doesn't mean you will be an expert at
what's required to make a good learning tool.

I've observed and taught thousands of cadets using games like Follow Me and
Virtual Battlespace in the classroom. 

did you say thousands? Yes, I'm afraid so. I've taught "whole graduating"
classes which typically number about 1000 cadets. Basic training classes are
even larger. For over five years I ran "whole classes" through Follow Me and VBS
exercises. 

I was lucky because few instructors could say they seen a whole
graduating class coming through their classroom doors.
