In most schoolhouses the Tactical Decision Game is a tool used to teach tactics.

Here are some characteristics of a typical TDG:
- Paper-based.
- Planning exercise.
- The student is given a situation and mission.
- They produce an OPORD, course of action and a map with graphics.

The instructor grades each of the products and gives the student some feedback on what they did right/wrong.

You gotta ask yourself is this really the best way to teach tactics?

In my opinion NO. I think it's incomplete because the student doesn't get
feedback from any of their decisions. The COA shows what they hope will be the
"end state." It's up to the instructor to fill in the blanks between the start
of the mission to the end, their COA.

The student misses everything in between.

## Why is it incomplete?
That's easy.

Execution.

The TDG is 100% planning, there's no execution piece. The instructor
grades the paper based on the cadet's COA and the instructors "judgement." In
fact different instructor's will grade differently, for example an Infantry
officer may grade the cadet's solution differently than an Artillery officer.

At West Point they try to get all the instructors to the same standard of grading by doing
some instructor development prior to teaching the lesson.

## How will the NextGen Wargame fix this?
First of all let's get something straight. The NextGen Wargame is NOT meant to
replace paper-based Tactical Decision Games (TDGs). 

The NGW is meant to improve the TDG by add execution component.

This is what you get: 
- It enables the student to practice in a dynamic operational environment where
  the enemy, terrain, and weather have an effect.
- The ability to practice in a safe, no-risk environment.  
- Experimentation. Imagine the learning that takes place when a student can
  compare and contrast different courses of action or tactics.
- Critical Analysis (AAR). Ability to watch a "replay" of the operation then
  analyze it step-by-step. What went wrong, and why? What went right, and why?
  What could be done better, and why? Well, you get the picture. WHY is arguably
  the most essential part of learning to think.  


## Tell me about the NextGen Wargame
Concept:
- The right level of detail, easy to play and understand.
- Playable in a web browser, the operating system does not matter.
- Explicitly designed as an education tool, NOT an exercise driver.
- Designed by someone who plays games, has over 20 years of military experience,
  AND who actually used games in a classroom setting (that's me).
