In most schoolhouses the Tactical Decision Game is one of the tools used to teach tactics.
The TDG is bascially a planning exercise with no execution piece. 

**How it works**  
1. The instructor gives the student a situation and mission. 
2. The student writes an OPORD and a course of action, and creates an
   overlay with the appropriate ops graphics on a map.
3. The instructor grades each of the products and gives the student some
   feedback. In some cases the instructor may lead a group discussion using one
   of the student's solutions.

The problem as I see it is there's no meaningful execution of the mission. 

- How does the student deal with an enemy that is also trying to impose its will? 
- 1st squad is ambushed moving to their support by fire position, now what? 
- The student observes way more enemy than anticipated, now what?

How does the student practice dealing with unexpected situations in a
paper-based TDG? They can't.

The student has no opportunity to see the effects of their decisions, nor do
they get the opportunity to "think" their way out of a problem.

## How will the NextGen Wargame fix this?
First of all let's get something straight. The NextGen Wargame is NOT meant to
replace paper-based Tactical Decision Games (TDGs). 

The NGW is meant to "complete" the learning experience by adding an execution
piece.

- It enables the student to practice in a dynamic operational environment where
  the enemy, terrain, and weather have an effect.
- The ability to practice in a safe, no-risk environment. Making the right level
  of decisions.
- Experimentation. Imagine the learning that takes place when a student can
  compare and contrast different courses of action or tactics.
- Critical Analysis (AAR). Ability to watch a "replay" of the operation then
  analyze it step-by-step. What went wrong, and why? What went right, and why?
  What could be done better, and why? Well, you get the picture. WHY is arguably
  the most essential part of learning to think.  

## Tell me about the NextGen Wargame
Concept:
- The right level of detail, easy to play and understand.
- Playable in a web browser, the operating system does not matter.
- Explicitly designed as an education tool, NOT an exercise driver.
- Designed by someone who plays games, has over 20 years of military experience,
  AND who actually used games in a classroom setting (that's me).

I should say something about that last point. Just because you're a gamer, or
someone with military experience doesn't mean you will know what is required
from a PME wargame. 

I have a unique blend of skills and experience when it comes to using games in
the classroom. I've developed lessons, created content, and written
requirements. 

More importantly I've used the very product that I helped develop
in a real world classroom. I'm not speaking from theory or something I observed
someone else doing, I'm speaking from experience.
