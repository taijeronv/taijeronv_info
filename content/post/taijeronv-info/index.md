I've always been interested in programming, creating software, and web
development.

My transition out of OSCE gave me the perfect opportunity to create a website.

This is what I used to create this site:
- I created the site using a static site generator called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
- All the content is written using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/). 
- For version control, I use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (command line), and I
  use [Github](https://github.com/) to store my repository.
- I host the site on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for free. 
- I registered my own domain name at [iwanmyname](https://iwantmyname.com/) (I
  have two other domains registered with them.).

## Why did you create this site?
- Branding
- Because I love "tinkering"
- It was easy
- I never heard of a static generator and wanted to know what the fuss was about.
