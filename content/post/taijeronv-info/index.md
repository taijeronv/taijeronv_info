I'm not a professional web developer, but it looks like I could be heading in that direction.  I really enjoyed the process of creating the site, tweaking how it looked, and writing the content.

I want to learn HTML5 and CSS3 so I can make the site look and do exactly what I want.  

Here's a list of technologies I used to create this website: 
- I created the site using a static site generator called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).  
- All the content is written using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/).  
- For version control, I use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (command line), and I store everything in a  [Github](https://github.com/) repository.  
- The site is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for free.  
- I registered my own domain name at [iwanmyname](https://iwantmyname.com/).

When I decided to start searching for a new job, I thought it would be a good idea to create a website.  I wanted to tell more of my story than what's on a Resume.  

My first thought was to use Wordpress, but then I started reading about the [JAMstack](https://jamstack.org/), which led me to static site generators.  I found [this website](https://www.staticgen.com/), which is how I discovered Hugo.

I installed Hugo, and within minutes I had a site up and running.  Hugo has an excellent library of pre-made themes after a few hours of trying different ones I decided on the [Academic theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/).  

Combining Hugo with Netlify really got things going.  In no time I had a web presence, all I needed now was to create some content.  In all honesty, this was the most time-consuming part.  You only have one chance to make an impression, which is why I took my time.

I found Mike Dane's Hugo series on Youtube to be a great introduction to Hugo and its features.

Working with Hugo has inspired me to learn more about web development, which is why I'm taking two courses on Udemy.

Colt Steele's [The Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/)
and Jonas Schmedtmann's [Build Responsive Real World Websites with HTML5 and CSS3](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/) both come highly recommended.

My next project will be a website for a local landscaping company.
