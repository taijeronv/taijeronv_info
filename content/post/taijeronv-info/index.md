I created this website without any knowledge of web development, and I think it turned out pretty good.

Here's a list of technologies I used: 
- I created the site using a static site generator called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).  
- All the content is written using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/).  
- For version control, I use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (command line), and I use [Github](https://github.com/) to store my repository.  
- I host the site on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for free.  
- I registered my own domain name at [iwanmyname](https://iwantmyname.com/).

I remember reading about [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which is a static site generator.  At the time, I didn't need a website, but when I started my job search, that's when it hit me that I could use something like Jekyll to set myself apart.

I tried using Jekyll, but I could never get any of the themes to work.  So, I did some research on [static site generators](https://www.staticgen.com/) and discovered [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

Hugo was straightforward to work with even though I had no experience with HTML, CSS, or static site generator.  Within minutes I had a site up and running, including the [Academic theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/), which is what you've been using.

I did a search on Youtube for a tutorial and found Mike Dane's Hugo series which is really good.

Mike's videos provided more details about how Hugo works and gave me a better understanding of its capabilities.  

Working with Hugo has inspired me to learn more about web development, which is why I'm taking two courses on Udemy.

Colt Steele's [The Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/)
and Jonas Schmedtmann's [Build Responsive Real World Websites with HTML5 and CSS3](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/) come highly recommended.

Once I've completed these two courses, I will start work on my next project, a website for a local landscaping company.

Even though it was easy to set up, I still had to do a lot of troubleshooting and problem solving to get things to work the way I want it.
