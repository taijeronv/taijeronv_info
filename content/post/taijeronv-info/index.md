I created this website without any knowledge of web development and I think it
turned out pretty good.

These are some of the technologies I had to learn:  
- I created the site using a static site generator called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).  
- All the content is written using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/).  
- For version control, I use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (command line), and I
  use [Github](https://github.com/) to store my repository.  
- I host the site on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for free.  
- I registered my own domain name at [iwanmyname](https://iwantmyname.com/) (I
  have two other domains registered with them.).

I started by trying to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) but I could never get
a theme to work and found it frustrating. I mean, you shouldn't have to jump
through hoops to get something to work especially if you follow the instruction.
I did more research about [static site generators](https://www.staticgen.com/)
and discovered [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

Mike Dane's Hugo series is really good if you're interested in giving it a try.

I really loved the experience of planning the site and creating the content and I'd like to learn more.

My plan is to start with Colt Steele's
[The Web Develeoper Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/)
and Jonas Schmedtmann's
[The complete Javascriot Course 2020: Build Real Projects](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/)
come highly recommended. I have two more projects in mind and would love to create them from the ground up.

Who knows maybe this will turn into a career opportunity.
