I created this website without any knowledge of web development.

Here's a list of technologies I used: 
- I created the site using a static site generator called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).  
- All the content is written using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/).  
- For version control, I use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (command line), and I use [Github](https://github.com/) to store my repository.  
- I host the site on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for free.  
- I registered my own domain name at [iwanmyname](https://iwantmyname.com/).

Hugo was straightforward to work with even though I had no experience with HTML, CSS, or static site generators.  Within minutes I had a site up and running, including the [Academic theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/).

I found Mike Dane's Hugo series on Youtube which improved my understanding of how Hugo works.

Working with Hugo has inspired me to learn more about web development, which is why I'm taking two courses on Udemy.

Colt Steele's [The Web Developer Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/)
and Jonas Schmedtmann's [Build Responsive Real World Websites with HTML5 and CSS3](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/) both come highly recommended.

My next project will be a website for a local landscaping company.
