I created this website without any knowledge of web development and I think it
turned out pretty good.

Here's a list of technologies I used: 
- I created the site using a static site generator called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).  
- All the content is written using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/).  
- For version control, I use [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (command line), and I
  use [Github](https://github.com/) to store my repository.  
- I host the site on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for free.  
- I registered my own domain name at [iwanmyname](https://iwantmyname.com/) (I
  have two other domains registered with them.).

I remember reading about [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) which is a static site generator.  At the time I didn't have a need for a website but when I started my job search that's when it hit me that I could use something like Jekyll to get something up and running fairly quick.

At first I tried using Jekyll but I could never get any of the themes to work.  So, I did some more research on [static site generators](https://www.staticgen.com/)
and discovered [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

From the very beginning working with Hugo was a different experience.  Within minutes I had a site up and running.  In about the same time I was able to install a theme and become immediately productive.  

Hugo has a decent library of free theme templates and I found one I liked.  The [Academic theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/) looks great and is easy to work with.

I then hopped on Youtube for a good tutorial and found Mike Dane's Hugo series which is really good.

Mike's videos provided more details about how Hugo works and gave me a better understanding of its capabilities.  

The build process is super easy and hosting on Netlify wasn't too difficult. I need to learn more about Netlify and all it has to offer, but at the moment I'm hosting two sites with custom domains on it and it's working great.

Working with Hugo has inspired me to learn more about web development which is why I'm taking two courses on Udemy.

Colt Steele's
[The Web Develeoper Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/)
and Jonas Schmedtmann's
[Build Responsive Real World Websites with HTML5 and CSS3](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/) come highly recommended.

I already have a pro bono opportunity to develop a website for a local landscaping company.  

I think this could be the beginning of a new career path.
