## Working title
Your game’s title should communicate the gameplay and the style of the game

## Concept statement
The game in a tweet: one or two sentences at most that say what the game is and
why it’s fun.

## Genre(s)
Single genre is clearer but often less interesting. Genre combinations can be
risky. Beware of ‘tired’ genres.

## Target audience
Motivations and relevant interests; potentially age, gender, etc.; and the
desired ESRB rating for the game.

## Unique Selling Points
Critically important. What makes your game stand out? How is it different from
all other games?

## Player Experience and Game POV
Who is the player? What is the setting? What is the fantasy the game grants the
player? What emotions do you want the player to feel? What keeps the player
engaged for the duration of their play?

## Visual and Audio Style
What is the “look and feel” of the game? How does this support the desired
player’s experience? What concept art or reference art can you show to give the
feel of the game?

## Game World Fiction
Briefly describe the game world and any narrative in player-relevant terms (as
presented to the player).

## Monetization
How will the game make money? Premium purchase? F2P? How do you justify this
within the design? Platform(s), Technology, and Scope (brief) PC or mobile?
Table or phone? 2D or 3D? Unity or Javascript? How long to make, and how big a
team? How long to first-playable? How long to complete the game? Major risks?

## Core Loops
How do game objects and the player’s actions form loops? Why is this engaging?
How does this support player goals? What emergent results do you expect/hope to
see? If F2P, where are the monetization points?

## Objectives and Progression
How does the player move through the game, literally and figuratively, from
tutorial to end? What are their short-term and long-term goals (explicit or
implicit)? How do these support the game concept, style, and player-fantasy? ##

## Game Systems 
What systems are needed to make this game? Which ones are internal (simulation,
etc.) and which does the player interact with?

## Interactivity
How are different kinds of interactivity used? (Action/Feedback, ST Cog, LT Cog,
Emotional, Social, Cultural) What is the player doing moment-by-moment? How does
the player move through the world? How does physics/combat/etc. work? A clear,
professional-looking sketch of the primary game UX is helpful
